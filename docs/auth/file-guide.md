# SpendSense authentication: file guide

This guide is a map of every file that takes part in signing users up, signing them in, keeping them signed in and signing them out, plus the landing page that leads into it. Each file has one entry, written from reading the code as it is on the `feat/landing-and-auth-pages` branch. Entries are grouped from the bottom up: configuration first, then the shared library, the auth feature logic, the pages and components, and finally the database tables. "Used by" lists come from searching the codebase for imports, so they show real connections. If you want the big picture first, jump to [How it all connects](#how-it-all-connects) at the end, then come back to the files.

## Config and entry points

### `src/auth.config.ts`

**What it does:** The "light" half of the Auth.js configuration: the settings that don't need the database. It turns on Google sign-in, says sessions are JWTs that last 7 days, points Auth.js's own sign-in and error pages at `/login`, and copies the user's id and role from the token into the session object the app reads. It's kept separate so the proxy can use it without pulling in Prisma.

**Runs on:** server only (imported by the proxy and by `auth.ts`). Not marked `server-only`, but nothing in it would work in a browser.

**Exports:**
- `authConfig`: the shared settings object (`trustHost`, `pages`, `providers`, `session`, `callbacks.session`), spread into both Auth.js instances.

**Depends on (imports):**
- Internal: none.
- Packages: `next-auth` (the `NextAuthConfig` type), `next-auth/providers/google` (Google sign-in).
- Environment variables read: `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` directly. Auth.js itself also reads `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` behind the scenes.

**Used by (imported by):**
- `src/auth.ts` (spreads it into the full configuration)
- `src/proxy.ts` (creates a database-free Auth.js instance for redirects)

**Security notes:** `session.maxAge` caps a stolen cookie's lifetime at 7 days. `pages.error: "/login"` means OAuth errors land on the login page with an `?error=` code, which the page maps to fixed messages (never printing the raw value). `trustHost` is only set to `true` when the env var says so, and never to `false` (see the handoff gotcha about `UntrustedHost`).

**Notes:** The `session` callback copies `token.sub` into `session.user.id`. The `jwt` callback that decides whether a token is still valid lives in `auth.ts`, not here, because it needs the database.
